# About Me

I'm an AI researcher currently working in Professor [Tan Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/)'s (National University Singapore) mathematical AI lab, as part of FPT AI Center's research residency. 

I study the **statistical foundations of frontier models**, in particular attention and mixture-of-experts (MoE), where I aim to leverage theoretical frameworks to understand, interpret, and improve these models. My research perspective is that frontier models and mechanisms may change, but the underlying mathematical principles that enable learning are (more) constant, and so by understanding the principles and foundations we can make consistent and lasting improvements to deep learning, no matter how the field continues to evolve. 

Recently, I've applied this approach to improving the representation capacity and robustness of the self-attention mechanism, where I used a nonparametric kernel regression framework to propose using [hyper-ellipsoidal attention regions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13770) (NeurIPS, 2024). I have also examined MoE through the lens of feature-weighted clustering optimization to propose a novel router that improves expert specialization, and promotes faster convergence and better robustness. Going further back, I've also worked on [an attention-based framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14765) for fair representation learning that goes beyond binary categorizations of fairness.

For future directions, I'm hoping to expand my research experience, that has predominantly centered on model-driven pretraining approaches, towards including in-context learning, finetuning, and model merging. No matter the direction, however, I hope to conduct research that leverages rigorous, statistical frameworks. I also have a nascent interest in alignment and mechanistic interpretability.

Prior to working with Professor Nguyen, I studied statistics at Columbia, where I was a funded research scholar working with Professor [Talia Gillis](https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/talia-gillis) on fair machine learning, and economics at Cambridge University and the London School of Econonmics.
