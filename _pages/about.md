# About Me

I'm an AI researcher currently working in Professor Tan Nguyen's (National University Singapore) mathematical AI lab, as part of FPT AI Center's research residency. 

I study the **statistical foundations of frontier models**, in particular attention and mixture-of-experts (MoE), where I aim to leverage theoretical frameworks to understand, interpret, and improve these models. My research perspective is that frontier models and mechanisms may change, but the underlying mathematical principles that enable learning are constant, and so by understanding the foundations we can make consistent and lasting improvements to deep learning. Recently, I've applied this approach to improving the representation capacity and robustness of the self-attention mechanism, where I used a nonparametric kernel regression framework to propose using hyper-ellipsoidal attention regions (NeurIPS, 2024). I have also examined the MoE router through the lens of feature-weighted clustering optimization to propose a novel router that improves expert specialization, and promotes faster convergence and better robustness.

Prior to working with Professor Nguyen, I studied statistics at Columbia, where I was a funded research scholar working with Professor Talia Gillis on fair machine learning, and economics at Cambridge University and the London School of Econonmics.
